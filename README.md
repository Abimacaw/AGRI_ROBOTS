# Robots

Welcome to the repository, I participated in the prestigious **ABU Robocon 2024** competition. This repository contains the code and script files developed during the creation of our two robots. As part of the technical team, I contributed to embedded programming and electrical systems.

## 🏆 ABU ROBOCON 2024
**ABU Robocon** is an exhilarating Asia-Pacific Techno-Sport Robotics Competition, a fast-paced, blood-pumping event that lasts for 3 minutes. The theme for 2024 is **"Harvest Day"**.

### 🤖 Robot R1
- **Type**: Semi-autonomous robot
- **Function**: Performs tasks based on sensor feedback for precision and accuracy.
- **Tasks**: 
  - 🌱 Picks and places seedlings in Area 1.
  - 🏀 Grabs and shoots balls from Area 2 to Area 3.
- **Control**: Operated primarily via a 🎮 PS5 joystick.
- **Key Features**: Mecanum drive for multi-directional movement and precise control.

### 🤖 Robot R2
- **Type**: Fully autonomous robot
- **Tasks**: 
  - 🚀 Moves from Area 1 to Area 3.
  - 🔍 Identifies team-colored balls and grabs them.
  - 🧺 Drops balls into a basket placed 2 meters away.
- **Capabilities**: 
  - 🌍 Navigation, mapping, and path planning.
  - 🎨 Color detection and object recognition.
  - ⚡ Locomotion with velocity control.
  - 🤖 Executes specific patterns for ball placement using AI, ROS, embedded systems, and electrical components.
- **Tech Stack**: 
  - 🧠 AI: YOLOv8
  - 🛠 ROS for robot control and automation
  - **Hardware**: Jetson Orin Nano, Arduino DUE, Intel RealSense D450 camera (for vision)
  - **Languages**: C++, Bash scripting
